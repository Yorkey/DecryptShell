How to use SHC Bash Script Compiler



copy shc binary to /bin (cp shc /bin)
give execute permissions (chmod +x /bin/shc)

#shc
This will give you all the options of the command.

    -f %s  File name of the script to compile
    -i %s  Inline option for the shell interpreter i.e: -e
    -x %s  eXec command, as a printf format i.e: exec('%s',@ARGV);
    -l %s  Last shell option i.e: --
    -r     Relax security. Make a redistributable binary
    -v     Verbose compilation
    -D     Switch ON debug exec calls [OFF]
    -T     Allow binary to be traceable [no]
    -C     Display license and exit

    Environment variables used:
    Name    Default  Usage
    CC      cc       C compiler command
    CFLAGS  <none>   C compiler flags

    Please consult the shc(1) man page.

Below is a example for how to use it.

#shc -e 31/12/2010 -m "Please contact Gourav Joshi at Gmail dot com" -r -f configs.sh

This will create 2 file as output;
config.sh.x
config.sh.x.c

We just have to rename the ".x"  file as some name.
e.g.
#mv config.sh.x configs
This will create a binary "configs", which we will give execute permission and use.
#chmod +x configs
# cp -ap configs /bin

Now we can use it directly.
#configs
